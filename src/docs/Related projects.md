This project is dedicated to the USB workflow of CircuitPython. For those interested in more diverse workflows, explore [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org/) and the associated [Adafruit tutorial](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/09/07/new-guide-circuitpython-web-workflow-code-editor-quick-start-adafruitlearningsystem-adafruit-circuitpython-makermelissa/) for **BLE**, **WIFI**, and USB workflows.

[Peterbay's fork of this repo](https://github.com/peterbay/CircuitPython-online-IDE2) (and the [CP Online IDE](https://ide.vavrin.eu/)) offers an alternative flavor that may better suit the needs of experienced users. 

Currently, this project does not support **MicroPython**. For online MicroPython coding, consider visiting [tinkerdoodle](https://tinkerdoodle.cc/) and the [micro:bit online Python Editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/3).

For those interested in **block programming** combined with CircuitPython, [Piper Make](https://make.playpiper.com/) is recommended.

This project will not be available on **mobile devices** due to mobile browser limitations. For mobile device alternatives, refer to Adafruit's tutorials [for Android](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-the-android-circuitpython-editor) and [for iOS](https://learn.adafruit.com/editing-circuitpython-on-ios-with-runestone/usage).
