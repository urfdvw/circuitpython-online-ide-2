# Version 1 Draft

I am over excide to announce that
CircuitPython Online IDE 2.0 Alpha is launched!
If you want to try it out,
the link is down in the description

In this video, I am going to explain

-   what does number 2.0 mean
-   what is alpha
-   and what is the plan for the future

Welcome to CircuitPythonic!
And I am River.

Before anything,
in case you don't know
CircuitPython is a python version that can run on microcontrolers and single board computers.
Its development is supported by Adafruit.
And
the CircuitPython Online IDE is a community open source project by me.
It is a browser-based IDE for CircuitPython
that can be easily used on almost any computer including Chromebooks with zero setup.
Without further due, let jump to the meat.

First, what does the number 2.0 mean.

If you have used CircuitPython Online IDE or followed me before,
you might know this bare bone version I call version 0,
and this nicer looking version I call version 1.
Version 0 was written when I just started to learn JavaScript,
you can tell.
Version 1 looks nicer, but it is still written in Vanilla JavaScript.
It works well but whenever I want to add new feature to it,
I found the code became more and more convoluted and harder and harder to maintain.
People often say that, if you are not using any front-end framework,
you are writing your own framework.
I never actually finished all the features I want in the folder view of version 1,
because I am finally up to a point I can not read my own code any more,
which gave me a push to switch to react.js.
During this almost whole year of disappearance,
I took some online courses,
and finally end up with this masterpiece(forgive me)
And happy to announce that CircuitPython Online IDE is into an new era:
The version 2.0

Then come that question, what does 'Alpha' mean?
Because I am an individual developer,
I can define my release cycles as I want.
In the development process,
When I finished implementing all the features I had before,
I call it an Alpha launch, aka internal test.
At this phase,
the IDE is fully usable,
but there could be some bugs.
So in this phase,
I will work on a CircuitPython project with the IDE.
Bugs are going to be fixed on the fly,
so the code code change very quickly.
In terms of exposure,
I would not push it too hard on social medias,
but there will be a notice on the current version mentioning the new version,
and open for them to test and give me feed back.
Another work during this phase is that I will finish all the text documentation,
so that when the IDE hit potential general public,
people won't be confused.

When I finish my first CircuitPython Project,
and fix all the issues along the way,
The IDE will be pushed to Beta.
In this phase, the 2.0 version will replace the 1.0 version on its current urls.
I will collect user feedbacks during this phase,
and fix bugs as reported.
Old versions will still exists but hosted on archived repos.
I will try to push it as hard as possible.
You will see tutorials, vlogs, and behind the scene talks posted on my social medias regularly.
And, of course, I will do another CircuitPython project in this time.

When I finish the 2nd project and fixed all reported issues in this period,
I will happily announce that version 2.0 is officially released.
But is that the end of version 2?
Of course not.

As I mentioned before,
the total reason for this version is to make it easier to add new feature.
2.0 version only have features from the 1.0 version,
but I do have a list of new features I want to add to it.
I will bump the minor versions while I add those features.

Is there going to be a 3.0 version?
As you can tell that 2.0 version is hosted on github page,
so it is a pure static front-end page.
But there are many features I have in mind will require a back-end.
I will post pone those features to version 3

So those are all the update announcements!

Also please comment below and let me know what you think.

Will see you in the next one.
And as always,
stay pythonic.

# version 2 GPT (modified)

Hey everyone, I'm super excited to announce that CircuitPython Online IDE 2.0 Alpha is now launched!
Find the link in the description below to try it out.

In this video, I'm going to talk about:

-   What '2.0' means.
-   What 'alpha' means.
-   And what's coming up next.

Welcome to CircuitPythonic! I'm River.

Just a quick intro, if you're new here: CircuitPython is a version of Python for microcontrollers and single-board computers. Its development is supported by Adafruit. The CircuitPython Online IDE is a community open source project by me. It's a browser-based IDE that works on pretty much any computers, even Chromebooks, with zero setup.

So, let's get started.

First, what does '2.0' mean?

If you've followed my work or used the CircuitPython Online IDE before, you might remember the very basic version 0 and the nicer version 1. Version 0 was my first try at JavaScript â€“ you can kinda tell. Version 1 was better but it is still written in Vanilla JavaScript. It worked, but the code became messier as I keep adding new stuff to it. Basically, I got to a point where I couldn't even understand my own code! That pushed me to re-write everything using React.js, which I call it the version 2.

Now, what does 'Alpha' mean?

So here is how I define the release cycles: 'Alpha' version, aka inner test version, means all the core features are implemented, but not really used in any real projects yet. In this phase, I'm using it for one of my CircuitPython projects and fixing problems as they pop up. You are very welcome to try it out and give feedbacks, but I'm not pushing it too hard on social media yet. Another big thing I'm doing now is writing up all the text documentations so everyone can get it easily when it's ready for public test.

After I finish my first project with it and sort out any issues, it's going to move to 'Beta', aka public test. That's when version 2.0 will take over the old version on the website. I will push it as hard as possible with tutorial videos and v-logs on my social media. I'll be looking for feedback from users and fixing any bugs they find. The old versions will still be around but hosted on archived repos. Plus, I'll do another DIY project with it myself.

Once I'm done with that second project and fix any issues that come up, version 2.0 will be officially released. But that's not the end. As the code is much more organized than before, it is easier to add new feature to it, and I do have a list of them planned. They are going to land on version 2.1, 2.2 etc.

What about a version 3? Well, version 2 is a pure front-end project hosted on GitHub Pages, but some of the ideas I have need something more, like a back-end. So, I'm thinking those will come in a future version 3.

So, that's the scoop! If you liked this video or find the IDE helpful, please hit like and share so more folks can see it. Drop a comment too and let me know what you think.

Catch you in the next one.

And always, stay pythonic.
