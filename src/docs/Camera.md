## Introduction

The Camera Tool is designed to help you visually capture your microcontroller hardware setup directly within the IDE. Whether you're a teacher presenting to a class or a maker documenting your project, this tool makes it easy to stream, inspect, or record live footage of your devices.

It’s especially useful for:

* **Educators** who want to demo physical circuits live.
* **DIYers and hobbyists** who want to record their setup or share their builds online.

### **Usage**

* **Flip & Rotate**: Adjust the camera feed by flipping horizontally/vertically or rotating in 90° increments to match your workspace.
* **Zoom & Lock**: Scroll to zoom in or out on specific parts of the image
* **Switch Camera**: Select from multiple connected webcams to get the best angle of your hardware.
* **Pop up**: Open the camera view in a separate window—perfect for multitasking or dragging onto a second monitor.
