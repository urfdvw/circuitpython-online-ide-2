This project is dedicated to the USB workflow of CircuitPython. For those interested in more diverse workflows, explore [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org/) and the associated [Adafruit tutorial](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/09/07/new-guide-circuitpython-web-workflow-code-editor-quick-start-adafruitlearningsystem-adafruit-circuitpython-makermelissa/) for **BLE**, **WIFI**, and USB workflows.

[Viper IDE](https://viper-ide.org/) is also great in many ways as it
- **Supports MicroPython**!!
- Use serial file system
- also has USB, WIFI and BLE connection options
- supports Android usb serial on supported devices

[Peterbay's fork of this repo](https://github.com/peterbay/CircuitPython-online-IDE2) (and the [CP Online IDE](https://ide.vavrin.eu/)) offers an alternative flavor that may better suit the needs of experienced users. 

This project will not be available on **mobile devices** due to mobile browser limitations. For mobile device alternatives, refer to Adafruit's tutorials [for Android](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-the-android-circuitpython-editor) and [for iOS](https://learn.adafruit.com/editing-circuitpython-on-ios-with-runestone/usage).
