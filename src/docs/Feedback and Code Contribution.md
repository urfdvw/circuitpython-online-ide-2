## Steps
1. **Review Existing Discussions:** 
You are encouraged to read through [[Troubleshooting]] and [the GitHub Issues and PRs](https://github.com/urfdvw/circuitpython-online-ide-2/issues?q=) before giving your feedback. You can do this even if you don't have a GitHub account. Please also take advantage of the search function.
2. **Provide Feedback:**  If you have a GitHub account, please provide your feedback by submitting an Issue. Add tags that are most related to your feedback. If you don't have a GitHub account, please fill in [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdupiJIRViFwPpuQC1hMp8gRvhxACLoAjgepm_-IRZumwK7Cg/viewform) or send an email to urfdvw@gmail.com. In that case, Github Issues will be created on your behalf. Please refrain from creating PRs directly before there has been a thorough discussion on the issue.
3. **Code Contribution**
In most cases, I will make changes to the code according to your feedback. However, contributions to the code by creating PRs are highly welcome. In such cases, please elaborate on what changes have been made and how to test them in the PR description. **All** PRs should be linked to existing issues. Code changes should focus on the issue, with very few exceptions on code quality improvements.
