Hello everybody. In this video, we're going to explore how to start using the CircuitPython Online IDE with your CircuitPython-supported microcontroller board. Let's get started!

[Text on screen: Setup]

To start, connect your microcontroller board to your computer using a USB cable.

[Scene transition: Screen capture of a web browser opening the CircuitPython Online IDE]

Now, open your web browser and go to the CircuitPython Online IDE. You'll find the link in the description below. This IDE will work with Chrome or Chromium-based browsers like Edge. In this video, I will use a Chromebook as an example.

Once the IDE loads, you'll see a 'Navigation' tab right in the middle of your screen. This will be your guide through the setup process.

[Scene transition: Clicking on Step 0. Install CircuitPython]

If this is your first time setting up CircuitPython on this board, you'll need to install it. Simply click on 'Step 0. Install CircuitPython' and follow this Adafruit tutorial. You can safely skip this step if you just did this recently.

[Scene transition: Clicking on Step 1. Open CircuitPy Drive]

Next, click on 'Step 1. Open CircuitPy Drive'. With CircuitPython installed, your board will appear as a USB drive on your computer. Navigate to the root directory of your microcontroller in the popup file explorer. Click 'open folder' and 'allow' to grant the IDE file editing permissions. You'll now see your files on the microcontroller in the 'Folder View' on the left.

[Scene transition: Clicking on Step 2. Connect to Serial Port]

Moving on to 'Step 2. Connect to Serial Port'. Select your microcontroller from the list and click 'connect'. You'll see data received from your microcontroller in the 'Serial Console' on the right. We will come back to this later.

Awesome, the setup is now complete! Next, let's take a look at how to edit and run the code on the microcontroller.

[Scene transition: Showing the IDE in 'Script mode']

On powering up, the microcontroller will start to run your Python code stored in the microcontroller.

[Scene transition: Editing a file in the IDE]

The entry point of all your code is the file called 'code.py'. Let's open the 'code.py' file by clicking on it in the 'Folder View'. Once you're done with editing, click the 'Save' button to save and run your code. You'll see the output in the 'Serial Console' tab, and also see the microcontroller doing its job.

Note that your microcontroller can also run the saved code with another power source like batteries or wall chargers.

[Scene transition: Showing REPL mode]
[Text on screen: REPL (Read-eval-print loop)]

REPL stands for Read-eval-print loop. In REPL, you can interact with your microcontroller in real-time. To start REPL, hit the `CTRL-C` button in the Serial Console until you see three right arrows in the terminal. Now, you can type code in the serial console and see the results instantly after clicking on `Send`.

If you need to switch back from 'REPL' mode to run the Python code stored on the microcontroller, just hit the `CTRL-D` button in the 'Serial Console'.
