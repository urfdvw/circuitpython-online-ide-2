"Welcome to CircuitPython Online IDE. In this video we're going to explore how to start using the CircuitPython online IDE with your CircuitPython-supported microcontroller board. Let's get started!"

[Scene transition: Close-up of the microcontroller board being connected to a computer via a USB cable.]

[Text on screen: "Step 1: Connect Your Board"]
[Voiceover]
"First up, connect your microcontroller board to your computer using a USB cable."

[Scene transition: Screen capture of a web browser opening the CircuitPython online IDE]
[Text on screen: "Step 2: Open the CircuitPython IDE"]
[Voiceover]
"Now, open your web browser and go to the CircuitPython online IDE. You'll find the link in the description below. This IDE only works in browsers like Chrome or Edge. But the good news is Chromebooks are also supported."

[Scene transition: Highlighting the 'Navigation' tab within the IDE]
[Voiceover]
"Once the IDE loads, you’ll see a 'Navigation' tab right in the middle of your screen. This will be your guide through the setup process."

[Scene transition: Clicking on "Step 0. Install CircuitPython"]
[Voiceover]
"If this is your first time setting up CircuitPython on this board, you’ll need to install it. Simply click on 'Step 0. Install CircuitPython' and follow this Adafruit tutorial. You can safely skip this step if you just did this recently."

[Scene transition: Clicking on "Step 1. Open CircuitPy Drive"]
[Voiceover]
"Next, click on 'Step 1. Open CircuitPy Drive'. With CircuitPython installed, your board will appear as a USB drive on your computer. Navigate to the root directory of your microcontroller in the popup file explorer. Click 'open folder' and 'allow' to grant the IDE file editing permissions. You’ll now see your microcontroller files in the 'Folder View' on the left."

[Scene transition: Clicking on "Step 2. Connect to Serial Port"]
[Voiceover]
"Moving on to 'Step 2. Connect to Serial Port'. Select your microcontroller from the list and click 'connect'. You’ll see system information and running results in the 'Serial Console' on the right."

[Text on screen: "Setup Complete!"]
[Voiceover]
"Awesome, the setup is now complete! Next, let's take a looks of how to edit the code on the microcontroller."

[Scene transition: Showing the IDE in 'Script mode']
[Voiceover]
"Your default mode is 'Script mode', which runs the python code stored in the microcontroller."

[Scene transition: Editing a file in the IDE]
[Voiceover]
"The entry point of all your code is the file called 'code.py'. Let's open the 'code.py' file by clicking on it in the 'Folder View'. Once you’re done with editing, click the 'Save' button to save and run your code. You’ll see the output in the 'Serial Console' tab."

[Scene transition: Showing REPL mode]
[Text on screen: "REPL Mode"]
[Voiceover]
"REPL mode lets you interact with your microcontroller in real-time. To start, hit the ‘CTRL-C’ button in the Serial Console until you see ‘>>>’ in the terminal. Now, you can type code in the serial console and see the results instantly after click on 'Send'."

"If you need to switch back to script mode from 'REPL' mode, just hit the ‘CTRL-D’ button in the 'Serial Console'."

[Scene transition: Ending scene with the project running successfully on the microcontroller]
[Voiceover]
"And that's the fundamentals of the CircuitPython online IDE!"
